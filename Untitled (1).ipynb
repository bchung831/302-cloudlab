    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on buffer-overflow vulnerability\n",
    "by putting what they have learned about the vulnerability from class into action. Buffer overflow is\n",
    "defined as the condition in which a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of pre-allocated\n",
    "fixed length buffers. This vulnerability can be used by a malicious user to alter the flow control of the program,\n",
    "leading to the execution of malicious code. This vulnerability arises due to the mixing of the storage\n",
    "for data (e.g. buffers) and the storage for controls (e.g. return addresses): an overflow in the data part can\n",
    "affect the control flow of the program, because an overflow can change the return address.\n",
    "In this lab, students will be given a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability; their task is to develop\n",
    "a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and finally gain the root privilege. In addition to the attacks, students\n",
    "will be guided to walk through several protection schemes that have been implemented in the operating\n",
